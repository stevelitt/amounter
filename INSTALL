Version 0.2.0

By Steve Litt

1) Make sure Python is installed. Almost every Linux
   computer in the past 5 years has Python.The Amounter
   software works with Python 2.7 and Python 3.4, and
   probably every recent Python.

2) They're probably already installed with your Python
   package, but make sure the following Python libraries
   are installed:
     * string
     * sys
     * types
     * re
     * os
     * subprocess
     * time
   You can quickly determine that they're all installed by
   running the libtest.py program that comes with
   Amounter.

3) Make sure the inotify command line interface programs
   are installed. The package will probably be called
   something like "inotify-tools".

4) Go to the directory *above* which you want to install
   Amounter, and type the following command:
    tar xczf amounter-0.2.0.tgz

5) As root, run the amctl.py program, and watch its output
   as you insert thumb drives. Be sure to unmount before
   physically yanking a drive, or you can lose data.

NOTES:

* Some distros might allow you to run this program as a
  certain group. If so, do that: It's more secure.

* Do not run any of this software from an init system or a
  process supervisor or from /etc/rc.local. You can get it
  to work like that, but you won't see important warnings
  telling you to unmount before removing a thumb drive.
