THE AMOUNTER THUMB DRIVE AUTOMOUNTER
Version 0.2.0

=== INTRODUCTION ===

The Amounter thumb drive automount software is designed to
have minimal dependencies or complications. It's
completely independent of file managers, window managers,
and desktop environments. Given the erratic track record
of various file managers with automounting, this is a key
advantage. Amounter doesn't need X: It can run anywhere
that Python and the Inotify command line tools exist. In
practice, it seems to automount within 5 seconds of
insertion.

To install it, read the INSTALL document.

To find out about its bugs, read the BUGS document.

=== USAGE ===

NOTE: 

Amounter must be running before you insert a thumb drive.
On many/most distros, you must run Amounter as root,
although some distros provide a group that can automount,
and on those distros, running Amounter as a member of that
group *might* work.

To run Amounter version 0.2.0, run the following as root:

amctl.py
